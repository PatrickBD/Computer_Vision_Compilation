# MNIST
My MNIST notebook (top 1% on Kaggle) 

The MNIST dataset is a favorite for image processing practice. While a decent CNN model can get 99% accuracy without too much trouble, adding some data augmentation, PReLU, and other tweaks got my best score up to 99.928% accuracy. On Kaggle, that puts it at around rank 25 of ~2000 at any given point (between the top 1 and 2 percent)

While keras comes with a MNIST set that can be imported, for the perpose of Kaggle's competition I only used their MNIST data set which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

# Other MNIST Notebooks

Going to try other image processing techniques, might as well try it out on MNIST so those are here too.
